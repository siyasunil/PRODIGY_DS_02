**Summary of Key Insights from Titanic Data Analysis**
Passenger Class and Survival:
Passengers in 3rd class had the highest mortality rate, followed by 2nd class, while 1st class passengers had the highest survival chances.
This is supported by a negative correlation (-0.34) between Pclass and survival, indicating better survival odds for higher classes (lower Pclass number).
There is also a strong negative correlation (-0.55) between Pclass and Fare, reflecting that higher class passengers paid higher fares.

Gender and Survival:
Females had a significantly higher survival rate than males, highlighting the “women and children first” rescue priority.

Overall Survival Rate:
About 38.4% of passengers survived, indicating less than half the passengers survived the tragedy.

Age Distribution by Survival:
Median age is similar (~late 20s) for both survivors and non-survivors.
Survivors include a wider range of older passengers (up to 80 years), whereas non-survivors show some young outliers (below 5 years).
Age has a slight negative correlation (-0.065) with survival, suggesting minor impact.

Fare and Survival:
Fare has a positive correlation (0.26) with survival, indicating wealthier passengers had better chances.

Family Relationships:
SibSp (siblings/spouses aboard) and Parch (parents/children aboard) show a moderate positive correlation (0.41), suggesting many passengers traveled with family.
However, family-related features show weak correlation with survival.

Overall Takeaway:
Class and fare were the strongest factors influencing survival. Gender also played a major role, with females more likely to survive. Age and family connections had lesser influence on survival outcomes. Survivors tended to be from higher classes, paid higher fares, and were often female.
